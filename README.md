## Background

I've been assigned the task of analyzing the data for a gaming company most recent fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli.

Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. As a first task, the company would like me to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.

## Three Observable Trends Based on The Data Analysis

It is almost 6 times more than the percentage of female players. In other hand, male players spend more money to purchase the games than femaleâ€™s.
